<p><span class="text-big">1. Introduction to EHA and EHA Machines</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><mark class="marker-green"><strong>If you are considering purchasing an Extreme Home Arcade (EHA) machine you have come to the right place! It is highly recommended your thoroughly read this Purchasing Guide and this section in particular so you can make informed decisions about EHA machines. &nbsp;EHA offers great machines, but they are not for everyone. &nbsp;</strong></mark></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Extreme Home Arcade's stated mission is to provide customers with the ultimate arcade experience at home. EHA machines are PC and Windows-based gaming systems that are sophisticated pieces of computer hardware and software that allow the user to play thousands of games on more than 80 emulators on one machine.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The current Omega hard drive has around 40,000 games on it. <a href="https://extremehomearcades.com/gamelist.aspx">Click here to search for games on EHA machines</a>. &nbsp;&nbsp;<u>EHA machines are mainly designed to play </u><strong><u>retro</u></strong><u> games</u>. &nbsp;While there are some newer games (say after 2005) these should be viewed as a “gift.” &nbsp;If you are looking to play newer games there are many other systems and services to do that. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">EHA machines run many emulators. &nbsp;Computer emulators are used to emulate the original game/computer system.&nbsp; Emulating all of these different computer systems is complicated.&nbsp; EHA machines are sometimes viewed more of a “hobby” than “plug and play” where you just turn it on and it works.&nbsp; <strong>All of this sophistication and ability to play tens of thousands of games on one system means that sometimes the user will encounter errors, problems, and glitches.&nbsp; This just comes with the territory.&nbsp;</strong> &nbsp;That said, most users are okay with that given the enormous range of games they can play on an EHA machine. &nbsp;Most users can get many, many years of entertainment and fun from their EHA machine.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Custom Built with Many Options</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><u>EHA machines are custom built</u></strong>. &nbsp;They are built according to the specifics of each customer. &nbsp;There is no “one-size-fits-all” with EHA. &nbsp; If you decide to purchase an EHA machine you will have to make many decisions about your system. &nbsp;That is a good thing! &nbsp;You will design your system to meet <strong>your</strong> specific needs. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The decisions you make will include the type of cabinet, computer hardware (such as different computer upgrades), different button layout, the number of users you want (typically 2 or 4-players), different marquees, and the like. &nbsp;In addition, each system can be purchased or used with a wide variety of peripherals including: light guns (AimTrak, Gun4IR, Sinden), wireless analog controllers, Tron/flight sticks, steering wheel/pedals, spinners, Wii controllers, joysticks, dance pads, and so on. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This guide is meant to help you learn about EHA machines and options in ordering a system. &nbsp;At EHA you are purchasing the custom cabinet and hardware for your machine. &nbsp; The software comes ("free") with your hardware. EHA supports your machine in many ways including free lifetime software updates.&nbsp; All you have to do is mail your boot drive and hard drive to EHA and they will install the new software on it and mail it back to you (you pay the shipping). In this way, you get new games and enhancements to your system as often as updates come out (there is no stated time for updates - they just come out from time to time).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Additional Resources</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A good resource you will want to take advantage of is the <strong>Extreme Home Arcades Owners Unite! Facebook page</strong>.&nbsp; This is a private user’s group site that is not sanctioned by or officially affiliated with Extreme Home Arcades.&nbsp; They are simply owners or would-be owners of Extreme Home Arcades machines, that share information and help one another. They are an excellent source of information and support for anyone who owns or who is interested in owning an Extreme Home Arcades machine.&nbsp; They have many posts, videos, weekly zoom calls and other tools to help each other. Once you are a member (even if you do not have a machine yet) you can post questions to the site and get feedback from other members. &nbsp; &nbsp; This wiki is written by members of this group. Another great source of information regarding Extreme Home Arcades machines is&nbsp; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">www.Youtube.com</a>.&nbsp; A search of Extreme Home Arcades and Omega on Youtube will result in may videos designed to help you learn about EHA machines. &nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Will I Be Able To Learn How to Use an EHA Machine?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Would-be purchasers and new purchasers ask this question regularly. &nbsp;If EHA machines are not “plug and play” and they are more meant for “hobbyists” can I do this? &nbsp;Most EHA customers pick up how to use EHA machines over time. Some have limited computer skills to begin with (this will grow as you use your machine) while others have years of computing experience. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A lot of games work with no problem, particularly those in the Arcade Classics menu (MAME games - Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator - Asteroids, Pac Man, Dig Dug, Space Invaders, etc.). &nbsp;Will you be an expert on day one or even after a year? &nbsp;No, probably not, &nbsp;but most people learn the ins and outs of their EHA machine over several months and pick it up. &nbsp;You can learn at your own speed and others in the Facebook site will assist you. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another thing to keep in mind is that some of the technical side of an EHA machine is customizing &nbsp;games to your specific likes, such as instead of playing games on the joystick/control panel you want to change this to an X-Box controller or instead of playing racing games with a joystick, you want to customize them to use your steering wheel/pedals. &nbsp;You can still play many games (like MAME games - hundred and hundreds) using your joystick/control panel and then later learn how to customize things. &nbsp;Learning how to map joysticks and other peripherals like X-Box controllers, flight sticks and steering wheel/pedals can take some time.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:29.19%;"><img src="/introandoverview/eha_owners_unite.jpg"></figure>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As mentioned previously, the <strong>Extreme Home Arcades Owners Unite! Facebook page &nbsp;and YouTube</strong> are a great way to learn your system. &nbsp;The EHA manual on this wiki is also a good source of information and is meant to help you quickly learn the basics. &nbsp;Look at the manual and see if it makes sense to you. &nbsp;Again, most users have no problem playing games instantly. &nbsp;In addition, EHA prides itself on helping its customers. &nbsp;EHA is always happy to provide outstanding customer support. &nbsp; If on the off chance you do not like or use your machine you can always sell it on the EHA Owners Unite! Facebook site as many people do not want to wait for a machine and see buying a used machine as a way to “jump” the wait line.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Full Disclosure and Adjusting Your Expectations</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Full Disclosure</strong> - In the interest of full disclosure, occasionally there are posts on the Extreme Home Arcades Owners Unite! Facebook page&nbsp;that go something like this: 1) I am a newbie, 2) I just spent $10,000 for an EHA machine; 3) I can't get some of the games to work, 4) I can't do what I want it to do; 5) I can't get my light guns to work; 6) I am frustrated. &nbsp; Until a “Matrix style” 10-second download of a tutorial on how to operate a helicopter is available for EHA users this is a possibility, particularly if your expectation is “plug and play.” &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Expectations</strong> - Setting reasonable expectations for your EHA machine is important. &nbsp;A personal story may help. &nbsp;If you have ever had a leaky faucet you may know that it <i>should</i> take about 10 minutes to replace the bushings in your faucet so it stops leaking. &nbsp; Most people will plan on it taking 10 minutes to do this job and then when it takes 3 hours and 3 trips to Home Depot they are frustrated and angry. &nbsp;Instead, if you set the expectation upfront that it will take you 3 hours to do the job and 3 trips to Home Depot then you can plan for it and when it takes that long, you have planned accordingly and it is manageable. &nbsp;Then, if it only takes 10 minutes great! &nbsp;You should set the expectation that it will probably take some months for you to be reasonably good at Big Box, Launch Box, Windows, emulators, gaming, mapping games, computer hardware, etc., and that it will be a journey.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some reasonable expectations for new uses are:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1) I am new to Big Box and Launch Box and it will take time to learn them, but I am open to the challenge and taking the time to learn;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2) I may not have a lot of Windows and computer experience, but I am willing to learn and will take the time to do so;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3) I will take the time to read the wiki manual, watch youtube videos, regularly read &nbsp;EHA Owners Unite! Facebook posts and attend their weekly Zoom calls;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4) I will start with easy things first like playing games in Arcade Classics (MAME) for a while and over time learn to map peripherals to those MAME games,;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5) I will gradually learn other wheels like TeknoParrot, wii and other systems that are easy to learn, before moving on to more difficult emulators;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6) I will make good decisions upfront like purchasing high quality light guns like Gun4IR and Sinden (which cost more) but are superior technically to cheaper Aimtraks (and will lead to a lot less frustration over time);&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7) &nbsp;I will consider not spending $10,000 on a 4-player machine with all the bells and whistles if I am unsure about setting the above expectations. &nbsp;In this case, maybe I will not get an EHA machine and get something more “plug and play” &nbsp;(see below), or get an EHA GameBox or Table Top with no bells whistles at a third of the price of Megacade&nbsp;(I can always sell it and upgrade later) ;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8) I will move slow and be patient. &nbsp;If a game does not work that I want to play, I will try a few things to solve for it and maybe ask people on the Facebook page and if that does not work, &nbsp;then I will simply move on and play something that does work.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Simpler Arcade Systems are Available</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you are uncomfortable with the above expectations and want something more plug and play, that is fine, there is nothing wrong with that. &nbsp; There are many arcade systems that play far less games, are more “plug and play” and are not custom builds, which might suit you better.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Helpful Strategies for Making Your Purchase</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With proper care an EHA machine can last for many, many years. &nbsp; There are many EHA machine owners that still have their machine after 10 or more years. &nbsp;Because your EHA machine can last for a long time it is important to keep this in mind when ordering your system. &nbsp;<strong>You should purchase your system for your current needs, but also for your future needs. &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are some things you can add to your system after the fact (like wii controllers, steering wheel/pedals, dance pads, etc). &nbsp;Other things, you are for all intents and purposes committed to (your cabinet style, your control panel style, your kick plate, much of your art, etc.). &nbsp;Said another way, you don't want to be “penny wise and pound foolish.” &nbsp;Many EHA users say it is important to “future proof” their machine and buy upgraded computer hardware that will last for many years to come. &nbsp;Most buyers will purchase all of the computer upgrades so their computer will handle newer games that are being added from time to time. &nbsp;It is also important to invest in the right cabinet for you. &nbsp;Do you want a 2-player or 4-player machine? &nbsp; &nbsp;Really think about what you want and give it thought. Hopefully, this guide will help you do that! &nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:30.46%;"><img src="/purchasingguide/buid_in_shop.jpg"></figure>
<p><strong>How Long Does it Take to Get My EHA Machine?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The answer depends, but typically it can be a six-month or more wait for your custom-built EHA machine. &nbsp;Why does it take so long? &nbsp;Well, for one, each system is custom-built. &nbsp;This takes longer than a mass produced machine. &nbsp;Also, EHA consistently has a substantial back-order of machines. &nbsp;In addition, it takes time to make high-quality custom builds and sometimes there are supply chain and other production issues. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How Does the Process Work?</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li style="text-align:justify;">One of the most efficient ways to start a purchase is to go to EHA's website and complete the <a href="https://extremehomearcades.com/order_form.html">Email Order Form</a> (see screenshot). &nbsp; Alternatively, you can call EHA at 715/212-8063. &nbsp;The order form will just help you prepare for the many decisions you have to make and it will give you an idea of what the cost of your build will be. &nbsp;Once you have completed the Email Order Form click on “Send to EHA" and this will get the process started.</li>
</ul>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:47.27%;"><img src="/purchasingguide/eha_order_form.png">
  <figcaption>EHA Order Form</figcaption>
</figure>
<ul>
  <li style="text-align:justify;">In a short time (usually within a day or two) EHA will contact you and talk through your build with you. &nbsp;This is a great time to ask any questions you have. The more organized you are and the more of have thought the build through, the faster and easier the call will be and the better your machine will match your expectations. &nbsp;If you have ideas about the graphics you would like on the cabinet, this is a good time to mention it to EHA.</li>
  <li style="text-align:justify;">Remember, this is a custom build so let them know anything you are thinking about. &nbsp;They will put together a written statement of your build and ask for a minimum down payment of $500. &nbsp; The down payment will hold your place in line. &nbsp; &nbsp;You have the option of making a larger down payment if you wish (this obviously means you will owe less when your machine is ready). &nbsp;You can also make payments along the way during the wait. &nbsp;<strong>After 4 weeks (from the start of the order) $500 of the down payment is non-refundable so if you change your mind later (and decide not to go through with the purchase), you will lose the $500 </strong>(but that is all you would lose)<strong>.</strong> &nbsp;They will give you an approximate time frame of when your machine may be ready.</li>
  <li style="text-align:justify;">After you make your order, time will seem like it is standing still and that your machine will never be ready… but it will. &nbsp;Use this time wisely! &nbsp;Read the Operating Manual on the wiki, join the Extreme Home Arcades Owners Unite Facebook page and read the daily posts (and attend their weekly zoom calls) and watch YouTube videos on EHA topics.</li>
  <li>Feel free to call or email EHA and ask them any questions you have and to check on your estimated build date.</li>
  <li style="text-align:justify;">When EHA is about ready to start your build they will contact you about your final system (and any changes you might have) and have you start approving the art work. &nbsp;Approving artwork starts about 4-6 out from when the final build is completed give or take. &nbsp; &nbsp;They will also give you a more definitive time of when your build will be completed and when your machine might be shipped.</li>
  <li>When your machine is ready to ship they will contact you for final payment and give you instructions regarding how to receive your machine and what to do if there is damage to your machine (see the EHA Omega Operating Manual for more information on this).</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="text-big"><strong>6. Classic &amp; Ultra-Wide Classic</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">EHA Classic machines come in 2 sizes, standard and ultra-wide. &nbsp;The standard Classic machines resemble the arcade cabinets of the 80's. &nbsp;They are a little smaller than Ultra-Wide and Megacades. &nbsp;Note: &nbsp;The Ultra-wide machine (see photo below) is very similar (nearly identical) in scale, size and weight as the Megacade, the shape of the cabinet is just more in the style of the old 80's machines, other than that, the Classic Ultra-Wide is the same as a Megacade. &nbsp;See the Megacade section if you are interested in an Ultra-Wide.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Below is an overview of the Classic machine. &nbsp;Since Ultra-Wides are nearly the same as Megacades, &nbsp;In addition, the positives and negatives of a Classic (compared against other EHA machines) are covered in this section.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Classic:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li style="text-align:justify;">2-player Classic machines are 30.5" W x 34" D x 72" H, while 4-player Classic machines are: 48"W x 38"D x 72"H. &nbsp;The 2-player Classic is smaller than the 2-player Megacade, so if size is an issue and you want an upright, a 2-player Classic could be the answer.</li>
  <li style="text-align:justify;">The 2-player Classic weighs in at 215 pounds while the 4-player comes in at 245 pounds, so they are still big machines, but not as heavy as Megacades.</li>
  <li style="text-align:justify;">Both the 2-player and 4-player machines come with a 32" TV. &nbsp;The TV is bright and has good graphics.</li>
  <li style="text-align:justify;">Like the Megacade the Classics have a good sound system with subwoofer, accepts headphones (and when the headship are being used they are quiet), &nbsp;have a PC and the computer hardware can be upgraded and replaced.</li>
  <li style="text-align:justify;">The Classics comes with wheels. The wheels perform well on hard surfaces like wood and cement. They do not perform particularly well on carpet. They get the job done, but it is not easy. The wheels however can be upgraded from wheels/casters from Amazon. &nbsp;See <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PG4BZYG?ref=nb_sb_ss_w_as-reorder-t1_ypp_rep_k0_1_8&amp;amp=undefined&amp;crid=1A2W5A3P8L8LT&amp;sprefix=4%2Bcaster&amp;th=1">here.</a></li>
  <li style="text-align:justify;">As with Megacades, Classics can accommodate light guns. &nbsp;It is best, if possible, to get your light guns from EHA when your Classic is purchased. &nbsp;<strong>They can set everything up for you (highly recommended). &nbsp;In this guide, it is recommended that you purchase </strong>high quality light guns like Gun4IR (highly recommended &nbsp;- Sindens are also a good light gun - see the light gun section in this guide for more details). &nbsp;The reason you want EHA to set everything up, among other things, is that the Gun4IR's LEDs for a Classic, if possible, should go <strong>behind the glass that is in front of the TV</strong>. EHA can easily do this when they are building your machine. You can do it later, after you get it home, but it is challenging. Having them do it right, at the “factory,” makes the most sense.</li>
  <li style="text-align:justify;">Classics can accommodate many external peripherals including steering wheel/pedals, X-Box controllers, flight stick, guitar, dance pad, etc.</li>
  <li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Classic machines can also accommodate a drawer in the front of the machine for storage (see photo below).</strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Below are photos of 4-player and 2-player Classics.</p>

</figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Classic Positives (versus other EHA machines):&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Smaller and more nimble than a Megacade if you are looking for an upright.</li>
  <li>EHA can setup everything on your Classic machine and it can come completely ready for you to play when it arrives (not so with Pedestals and GameBoxes - the user will have work to do to finish the setup regarding a TV and light guns).</li>
  <li>Plenty of room on the playing field for multiple people to play.</li>
  <li>Can accommodate an active or passive marquee.</li>
  <li>Because the top of a Classic is flat it can accommodate a third monitor.</li>
  <li>It is a all-in-one system, unlike a pedestal or GameBox (where you have an external TV).</li>
  <li>Like all uprights, Classics have a lot of space &nbsp;on the sides to accommodate a number of graphics to personalize your machine.</li>
  <li>Classics and all uprights have a lot of space in the cabinet. This is good to keep heat down (heat is bad for computers) and is really good for having room to make modifications to your computer. &nbsp;Other machines like Pedestals, GameBoxes, Table Tops and Cocktail Tables have small cabinets so it is “tight” to work on your computer when you need to.</li>
  <li>Classics can have a drawer option for storage in the front of the machine.</li>
  <li>Classics are less expensive than their Megacade counterparts.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Classic Negatives (versus other EHA machines):&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>The Classic, while smaller than a Megacade is still relatively large and heavy. &nbsp;It goes through doors and tight places better than a Megacage, but they are still large and heavy machines. &nbsp; EHA can cut your Classic horizontally under the monitor, if needed.</li>
  <li>While active marquees are great and Classics can accommodate them easily, you have to be prepared to support them when there are problems.</li>
  <li>Because the TV sits behind glass it can be difficult to add LEDs for light guns like Gun4 IR.</li>
  <li>Because the TV is built into the machine, if it needs to replaced (unlikely, but possible), it would be difficult.</li>
  <li>Classics have smaller TVs than Megacades (Ultra-Wides have the same size TV).</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="text-big"><strong>B. Cocktail Table</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Cocktail tables are 2-person machines (though a 4-person is possible) that are reminiscent of the old Ms. Pacman and other arcade machines from the 80's where the user will sit down to play them. &nbsp;Below are photos of 2 different, 2-person cocktail table designs. &nbsp;This is the one EHA machine that does not play all of the games uprights, Pedestals, Table Tops, and GameBoxes can play. &nbsp;This is because light gun games, wii games and some others do not work well on the horizontal screen of Cocktail Tables. &nbsp; They do play games with other peripherals such as X-box controllers. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Below is an overview of Cocktail Tables. &nbsp;In addition, their positives and negatives (compared against other EHA machines) are covered in this section.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cocktail Tables:</p>
<ul>
  <li>They are 30” W x 34” D x 31” H and sit on the floor (see photos below). &nbsp;While they are shorter than the uprights, they are still quite heavy at 225 pounds.</li>
  <li>They come in two different, 2-person styles cabinets.</li>
  <li>The TV is 32" 1080p.</li>
  <li>The machine comes with a standard sound system (including subwoofer) and accepts headphones. &nbsp;When the headphones are being used the machine is very quiet. The joysticks and buttons make very little noise.</li>
  <li style="text-align:justify;">Like any PC, it's computer hardware can be upgraded and replaced</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Below are photos of two table top machines.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Cocktail Tables Positives (versus other EHA machines):&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>They are a sit-down style machine.</li>
  <li>Cocktail tables are an all-in-one system.</li>
  <li>Cocktail tables have some room for graphics on the cabinet (but not as much as an upright).</li>
  <li>They plays some, but not all, of the same games as uprights and pedestals.</li>
  <li>They can accommodate a neon kick plate.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Cocktail Tables Negatives (versus other EHA machines):&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>They are heavy at 225 pounds.</li>
  <li>Cocktail Tables have small cabinets so when you need to work in the cabinet on the computer space is tight.</li>
  <li>They have smaller TV screens (32") than the larger uprights.</li>
  <li>The tight space in the cabinet as the potential to create heat concerns for the computer motherboard and graphic board (this can be solved for by additional fans or a cooling system if that occurs).</li>
  <li>Cocktail tables cannot play all of the games other machines can play due to the horizontal screen.</li>
  <li>Flight sticks, steering wheel/pedals, light guns, Wii controllers, guitars and dance pads do not work at all or do not work well with cocktail tables.</li>
  <li>There is no option for a &nbsp;passive or active marquee.</li>
</ul>

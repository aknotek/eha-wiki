<p><span class="text-big"><strong>3. Build Options</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the next sections the different types of standard EHA builds (Megacade, Classic, Stealth, Pedestal, GameBox, Table Top, and Cocktail Table) will be discussed in detail.&nbsp; Before those are covered, it is helpful to discuss the many build options you have, no matter the type of machine you are considering.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>A Word About Personal Preference</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When you are selecting options for your EHA machine there are no “right” or “wrong” answers. &nbsp;All of the machines have the same basic computer hardware and software (with some minor differences), will play the same games (thousands and thousands) and last for years.&nbsp; &nbsp;The type of cabinet you get, along with the many options on the machine (joysticks, buttons, etc.) largely comes down to your personal preference. Do you like the “classic” style of cabinet, reminiscent of the 80’s, or do you like the newer look of the Megacade/Stealth?&nbsp; Do you like solid color buttons/joysticks on your machine or do you like the look of lighted ones? If you are going with lighted buttons do you like a plain lighted (1 color) button or do you want to spend the extra money for RGB buttons that can display any color?&nbsp; Again, there is no right or wrong answer, it comes down to your (and your family’s) preference and your budget.&nbsp; &nbsp;For example, someone might like 4 spinners on their machine to play a particular game they loved playing with friends growing up. &nbsp;Most EHA customers would not want this, but EHA can accommodate most requests like this – it just comes down to your tastes and wishes. &nbsp;To extent possible, this guide will try and give you all the facts so you can make your own informed decisions. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>BUILD OPTIONS:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Joystick/Control Panel Shape – Standard or “Battleship”</u></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On Megacades, Stealths, Pedestals and GameBoxes you have the option of choosing a “standard” joystick/control panel shape or a “battleship” shape. If you do not specify you will receive a standard shape.&nbsp; See photos below.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The “Battleship” style joystick/control panel is currently very popular.&nbsp; This is particularly appealing to users that enjoy playing visual pinball games.&nbsp; On a standard 4-play joystick/control panel the player uses Player 1’s buttons to plunge the ball, press the flippers and “nudge” the machine. While this functionally works fine, it does not mimic the feel of a real pinball machine.&nbsp; With a “battleship” style joystick/control panel the flipper buttons are put on the side of the machine (see yellow arrows in photo below).&nbsp; The plunger button is the big red button under player 3’s buttons (see red arrow in photo below). &nbsp;This creates a more realistic pinball feel.&nbsp; There is an extra cost for the “battleship” joystick/control panel. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Note: all 2-player machines come standard with flipper buttons on the side of the joystick/control panel.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Standard Shape Joystick/Control Panel</strong></p>

</figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Button Layout – Standard v. Custom/Scantron</u></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You have the option of customizing your button layout on your joystick/control panel.&nbsp; In a standard layout, Player 1 and 2’s button are stacked together with 2 sets of 4 buttons directly beside and on top of each other (on the machines they are slightly arched).&nbsp; You can have any button configuration you would like, but the Scantron button configuration is very popular.&nbsp; &nbsp;In a standard button configuration the button numbers are like this:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1 &nbsp; 2 &nbsp; &nbsp;3 &nbsp; 7</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4 &nbsp; 5 &nbsp; &nbsp;6 &nbsp; 8</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Scantron button layout, buttons 7 and 8 are below and to each side of buttons 4 and 6 (see diagram below).&nbsp; The Scantron button configuration is popular if the user plays a lot of fighting games like Mortal Kombat.&nbsp; In addition, the configuration is easier for many players to use.&nbsp; There is no extra cost for the Scantron Button Configuration.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/purchasingguide/standard_v_custom_scantron_layout.png">
  <figcaption>Standard v. Custom/Scantron Button Layout</figcaption>
</figure>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Notice in the previous photo above (the machine that says “Big Box” in the marquee - which has the battleship joystick/control panel) Player 1 and 2's buttons are in the standard configuration. &nbsp;In the photo below (Discs of Tron) the machine has a custom/Scantron button layout. &nbsp;Sometimes there is a modified Scranton layout where Button 7 is to the left, but button 8 is eliminated (this is an older style of the Scantron layout - this has been replaced with &nbsp;layout shown above).&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In a custom/Scantron button configuration the button numbers are like this:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1 &nbsp; 2 &nbsp; &nbsp;3 &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4 &nbsp; 5 &nbsp; &nbsp;6 &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;7 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;8</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

</figure>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><u>Buttons Lighting: &nbsp;Non-Lighted/Standard, Lighted and RGB Buttons</u></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You have several options regarding lighting or not lighting your buttons on your joystick/control panel.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Non-Lighted/Standard Buttons</strong> - Standard buttons have no lighting but come in a variety of colors.&nbsp; Notice in the photo above &nbsp;(Discs of Tron) that the buttons are not lighted and are white, blue, red, and green.&nbsp; You can select what solid colors you would like your buttons to be. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Lighted Buttons</strong> - In contrast, look at 2 photos above (Big Box).&nbsp; &nbsp;Notice that these buttons are lighted and have a glow to them. These are lighted buttons.&nbsp; &nbsp;The lighted buttons cost extra but are popular.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>RGB LED Buttons</strong> <strong>and LED Blinky</strong> - You also have a choice of having RGB LED buttons.&nbsp; &nbsp; These can be programmed to have any color. This is done by using a program called LED Blinky.&nbsp;&nbsp;LED Blinky will “animate” your buttons by turning them off and on in different patterns and in different colors.&nbsp; You can use standard default settings (which EHA will do for you) or customize them yourself. A lot of people like the RGB and LED Blinky option. RGB buttons are an extra cost and LED Blinky requires a license (and a small fee). &nbsp; You can see a demonstration at:&nbsp; “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTLES4KRmkM">LED Blinky intro animation demo</a>” or <a href="http://www.ledblinky.net">www.ledblinky.net</a>. &nbsp;RGB buttons are very popular. The “Megacade” photo (StarCastle machine) above has RGB buttons. &nbsp;LED Blinky is also another feature that sometimes requires some technical support from time to time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You will want a plan for your buttons (what color and type for each player on your machine).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><u>Joystick – Non-Lighted/Standard, Lighted, and RGB</u></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Customers &nbsp;have several choices regarding their joysticks for their joystick/control panel. &nbsp;Among others, you can select the non-lighted standard joysticks or for an additional cost, lighted joysticks.&nbsp; Again, this is personal preference. It important to note that all EHA joysticks are ARCADE quality.&nbsp; Some people note that the lighted joysticks (SANWA (ASIA) have a “looser” feels – that is, they have less spring to return to center. Standard, non-lighted joysticks (Happ, IL EURO) tend to have a “tighter” feel.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Note: Joystick feel and how a joystick performs can be a controversial issue.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some users are very particular about their joysticks. &nbsp;You can work with EHA and have whatever joysticks you would like installed. &nbsp;Sometimes,&nbsp;depending on the type of joystick there is an additional cost. &nbsp; &nbsp;A photo of standard non-lighted joysticks are above (Discs of Tron). The sample earlier of a “Megacade” (StarCastle) has lighted joysticks.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you get a standard joystick they come in a variety of colors, so you will want to plan for what color you would like them to be.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What joysticks you want are an important decision. &nbsp;If you get the lighted ones and they don't “feel” good to you there is not a lot you can do after you get your machine, since they are wired into your joystick/control panel.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>8-Way Joystick</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Notice in the “Discs of Tron” photo above there is a black joystick to the left of the spinner.&nbsp; This comes standard with EHA’s machines (it is in almost every photo).&nbsp; It is a special 4-way joystick that is used for playing games like Pacman, Dig Dug and the other older arcade games of that era.&nbsp;Those games used 4-way and not 8-way joysticks.&nbsp; 8-way joysticks are the standard now. &nbsp;A 4-way joystick only goes up, down, left, right while an 8-way joystick also goes up, down, left, right but also diagonally – &nbsp;toward each corner.&nbsp; If this does not appeal to you – you can have EHA leave the 4-way joystick off and have less clutter on your joystick/control panel. &nbsp;Most customers leave them on, but it is debatable whether they get used much.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><u>Trackball – Standard, Lighted or RGB</u></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The trackball on your joystick/control panel can also be non-lighted (standard), lighted or RGB.&nbsp; The above sample of a GameBox (Gib's Arcade) has a non-lighted, standard trackball.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can get the standard trackball in a variety of colors. &nbsp;The photo above (Discs of Tron) has a lighted trackball.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><u>Spinners&nbsp;</u></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You have the option of having a spinner on your joystick/control panel. Spinners are used in games like Tempest, Arkanoid, etc. Spinners come in different colors.&nbsp; Like anything else, some people like them and use them and some do not. It is optional whether you have a spinner (or multiple spinners) installed on your machine or not. &nbsp;Most customers have one spinner. &nbsp;You will notice that most of the machines in the photos in this section have a spinner.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><u>Tron Joystick/Flight Stick</u></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A Tron Joystick/Flight Stick can be installed on your joystick/control panel (Discs of Tron and others). They also can come in different colors and can be lighted.&nbsp; However, &nbsp;a Tron stick on your joystick/control panel is controversial in the EHA community.&nbsp; &nbsp;As with anything else it is personal preference and there are advantages and disadvantages.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The advantage is that it is always there and if you are randomly playing games and come across a flying game or a game that would work well with a flight stick this it is great (Tron, Star Wars Battle Pod, Star Wars original game, etc.)&nbsp;&nbsp; An alternative to a permanent flight stick on your joystick/control panel is to have one that is standalone and just attaches with suction cups – like a steering wheel/pedal setup and you just plug it in when you need it.&nbsp; &nbsp;The downside of a stand alone joystick is that you have to find it, set it up, plug it in etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You can buy PC based flight sticks that have more buttons and more features than the Tron stick.&nbsp; The disadvantages of a permanent Tron/flight stick is that it is tall and some users feel that it blocks their sight of the TV– particularly on all upright machines including the Megacade.&nbsp; It doesn’t usually interfere with light gun use, but that is also a fear.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There really is no clear consensus in the EHA community on this issue. &nbsp;It comes down to personal preference. &nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><u>Graphics On Your Joystick/Control Panel</u></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You can do some great things with graphics on your joystick/control panel. &nbsp;It is particularly interesting when you can include the trackball into your design (see below in the “compass” design) or when you can make it blend in to your design “Star Wars” or “control panel” (see below). &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:83%;"><img src="/scantron_buttons2.jpg"></figure>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><u>Under Panel Lighting</u></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">EHA can install lighting under your joystick/control panel for an additional cost.&nbsp; They can also install lighting inside your cabinet where your machine’s computer is.&nbsp;This is very helpful since it is typically dark inside the cabinet - this makes it difficult to see if you have to access and work on your computer.&nbsp; Alternatively, you can add this yourself (rather inexpensively) later by purchasing some LED lights on Amazon. The “Pedestal” photo above shows under panel lighting.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><u>Neon Ring Kick Panel&nbsp;</u></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another option for your machine is to add a neon ring kick panel under your joystick/control panel for an additional cost. See photo below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/eclipse_buttons_neon_ring.jpg">
  <figcaption>Megacade with Neon Ring Kick Panel</figcaption>
</figure>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><u>Coin doors</u></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another option is to add 1 or more coin doors under your joystick/control panel. &nbsp;This can give your machine &nbsp;authentic arcade machine look (see photo below). &nbsp;There is an extra cost for coin doors.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/mega_cade_with_coin_lock.jpg">
  <figcaption>Megacade with Coin Doors</figcaption>
</figure>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><u>Other Things</u></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are a variety of other options to consider for your machine.</p>
<ul>
  <li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Additional USB Ports - </strong>There are many advantages to adding <strong><u>1 - 4 additional USB</u></strong> ports in the front of your machine. &nbsp;Uprights and pedestals come with 2 USB ports under the joystick/control panel. They accommodate 2 light guns. &nbsp;However, if you want play a game with an external steering wheel/pedals or flight stick you need to unplug a light gun. &nbsp;If you can, it just makes sense to add 1-42 additional USB ports in the front - it will enhance your gaming experience. This can be done after the fact, but having EHA do it is easier and not expensive at all (highly recommended). &nbsp;</li>
  <li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Additional Hard Drive</strong> - Omega comes with a 16 Tb. hard drive. &nbsp;The drive is completely full of games. &nbsp;If you have Steam games you want to save, there really is no room, so if you have some additional space for games and other downloads it would be helpful. &nbsp;EHA can add an additional hard drive for you.</li>
  <li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Better Wheels</strong> - EHA Uprights and Pedestals come with wheels. &nbsp;However, they do not work great on carpet. They are minimally acceptable. &nbsp;If your machine will be on carpet and you need to move it a lot consider an upgrade. &nbsp;If you are going to just get it to a spot and never move it then, they are fine. Alternatively you can do this yourself, but changing on an upright can be a little challenging.</li>
  <li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Extra Cooling Systems/Fans - </strong>Uprights have quite a bit of room inside the cabinet so you may not need additional cooling systems for them. Pedestals, Table Tops, GameBoxes and Cocktail tables - have more tight cabinets where air does not move as well. &nbsp;You may want to consider a more robust cooling system or fan if you encounter problems. &nbsp; The reason this is important is that a hot CPU can burn out your motherboard or graphics card - this is bad. &nbsp;In addition, you can get error messages from your system saying it is hot and needs to cool down. Alternatively, you can add a fan from Amazon or other cooling system later.</li>
  <li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Keyboard&nbsp;</strong> - A wired or wireless keyboard is a must. &nbsp;You can add one after the fact.</li>
  <li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Drink Holders</strong> - EHA will not install drink holders on your machine. &nbsp;Some users have installed these on their own. &nbsp;It is not recommended particularly if you have children playing on your machine (and trust us - <i>you will have children playing on your machine</i> - think "bees to honey"). &nbsp;Spills can happen for anyone, even for adults. &nbsp; As you know, computers and liquid do not mix. &nbsp; If you open your joystick/control panel and see all of the wires coming out of it, you will have a better understanding of why having a drinks around your expensive machine is a bad idea, but this is your call.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="text-big"><strong>A. GameBox</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The GameBox is the smallest, most portable, lightest and least expensive arcade machine EHA offers. Even so, it plays exactly the same games as EHA's other systems. &nbsp; &nbsp;Games boxes can come in either 2-player or 4-player versions.</p>
<p>Below is an overview of GameBoxes. &nbsp;In addition, their positives and negatives (compared against other EHA machines) are covered in this section.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>GameBoxes:</p>
<ul>
  <li style="text-align:justify;">2-Player GameBoxes are 36"W X 19"D X 5.5"H (45 pounds) and 4-player GameBoxes are 48"W X 19"D X 5.5"H (55 pounds). One person can move a GameBox.</li>
  <li style="text-align:justify;">They are the most portable of all EHA machines. They can go through doors easily and move from room to room or house to house with no problem. &nbsp;All the users needs to do is hook them up to a HDTV.</li>
  <li style="text-align:justify;">GameBoxes do not come with a TV, so you must supply it. &nbsp; &nbsp;This allows the user to use any TV they want. They are not limited to a particular size like in an upright. &nbsp;While a Megacade's TV is limited to 43" for a 2-person and 50" for a 4-player a &nbsp;GameBox user can connect it to a 65" or 80" TV. &nbsp;Keep in mind the recommended viewing distances for large screen TV's if you are putting these in smaller rooms. &nbsp;For example, the recommended viewing distance for a 65" TV is 8.5' to 13' feet. &nbsp;The viewing distances for an 80" TV is 10' to 16.5'.</li>
  <li style="text-align:justify;">Because the user is supplying the TV the user must also set up their display in Windows, EHA cannot do this for you. It is not difficult, but the user has to do it.</li>
  <li style="text-align:justify;">A GameBox can accommodate light guns. &nbsp;The only difference here is that since the TV does not come with the system EHA cannot set up your LEDs that go on the TV. &nbsp;Likewise, EHA cannot setup with Wii lightbar for you (if you purchase the Dolphin bar). &nbsp;You will need to do this yourself.</li>
  <li style="text-align:justify;">GameBoxes have stereo speakers with build-in amplifier (no subwoofer), but many users play sound through their TV (HDMI) or through a sound box from the TV.</li>
  <li style="text-align:justify;">Sounds controls are located on the front of the GameBox and include a headphone jack and tone controls.</li>
  <li style="text-align:justify;">The PC in GamebBox can be upgraded and replaced.</li>
  <li style="text-align:justify;">GameBox can use “battleship” joystick/control panel.</li>
  <li style="text-align:justify;">GameBoxes can accommodate the same external peripherals as the uprights including steering wheel/pedals, X-Box controllers, Tron/flight stick, guitar, dance pad, etc.</li>
  <li style="text-align:justify;">A GameBox can accommodate a passive or active marquee if mounted below or above the TV on the wall.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>GameBox Positives (versus other EHA machines):&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>The lightest of all EHA machines.</li>
  <li>The least expensive of all EHA machines.</li>
  <li>The most portable of all EHA machines.</li>
  <li>The smallest of all EHA machines.</li>
  <li>Can accommodate an active marquee if placed above or below the TV on the wall.</li>
  <li>Can accommodate larger TV sizes, larger than the uprights.</li>
  <li>Can accommodate all peripherals such as a light gun, steering wheel/pedal, X-Box controllers, guitar, dance pad, flight stick, etc.</li>
  <li>Plays all of the same games as uprights and pedestals.</li>
  <li>Can accommodate flippers on the side of the joystick/control panel.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>GameBoxes &nbsp;Negatives (versus other EHA machines):&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Not an all-in-one machine like an upright where everything comes with it, the user must supply the TV.</li>
  <li>The user must setup their TV/display in Windows and must install their LEDS on their TV for light guns and install the wii light bar for wii controllers (if they buy these options).</li>
  <li>Little room for graphics on the cabinet.</li>
  <li>Have tiny cabinets so when you need to work in the cabinet on the computer it is extremely tight.</li>
  <li>The tight space in the cabinet has the potential to create heat concerns for the computer motherboard and graphic board. GameBoxes come with an extra fan.</li>
  <li>There is not subwoofer in the sound system.</li>
</ul>

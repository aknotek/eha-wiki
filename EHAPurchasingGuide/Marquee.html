<p><span class="text-big"><strong>4. Marquees</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A marquee or marquees are available for all upright cabinets, Pedestals, GameBoxes and Table Top machines. &nbsp;Marquees are generally not an option on &nbsp;Cocktail Tables. &nbsp;Marquees are available in two primary styles, passive and active.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Passive Marquee</u></strong></p>
<p>A passive marquee means it is just a “sign.” &nbsp; It is typically backlit, but does not move or change. &nbsp;It may say: “X's Arcade." &nbsp; See photos below.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Passive marquees (or active for that matter) are available for Pedestals and GameBoxes. &nbsp;They can be mounted on the machine (see above).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Active Marquee</u></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An active marquee means that the marquee is a computer monitor and that the message will change. &nbsp;You can purchase different sizes marquees for your machine. &nbsp;When you buy an active marquee, EHA will design a start-up video for you that will play when you load your machine. &nbsp;When you move through Big Box and or load a game, the active marquee will change and display the name of the game you are playing. &nbsp;See photos below. This is similar to &nbsp;having 2 monitors on your PC. &nbsp;The difference is that the TVs/monitors are completely different sizes and orientations. &nbsp;This will need to be set up in Windows. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An advantage to purchasing an active marquee when you buy your machine is that EHA will set it up and install it for you. &nbsp;If you add one after the fact you will need to install it and set it up and install it yourself. &nbsp;there are videos on www.youtube.com on how to do this. &nbsp; Sometimes there are issues with an active marquee like an emulator playing the game in the marquee and not the main screen. &nbsp;These issues can be worked through, but it does add some additional complexity to the machine. Having an active marquee is currently a very popular feature. &nbsp;Sometimes a user will buy a machine, like a Megacade with a passive marquee built in and then either replace it with an active marquee later or alternatively, add a passive marquee on the top of the machine. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Pedestals and GameBoxes also support an active marquees, but more often than not they are mounted above or below their TV on the wall.&nbsp;</p>

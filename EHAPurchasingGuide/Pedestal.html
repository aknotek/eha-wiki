<p><span class="text-big"><strong>8. Pedestal and Pedestal Combo</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">EHA Pedestal machines are a stark difference from the uprights (Megacade, Classic and Stealth). Pedestals are a third of the weight of a Megacade. &nbsp;They are more easily moved than uprights, but because the joystick/control panel is so large, they can still represent challenges getting through doors. &nbsp;This can be solved by either removing the joystick/control panel or leaving it attached and rotating it 90 degrees (this will sometimes allow it to move through doors without having to completely remove it).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Pedestal achieves the weight reduction (among other things) by not having a TV in the machine. &nbsp;This does however mean the user must supply their own TV and mount it in some manner.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Pedestal Combo</strong> - The Pedestal Combo is listed as an option on the EHA website. &nbsp;In a standard Pedestal the computer, bass speaker, etc. is housed in the <strong><u>bottom</u></strong> of the cabinet. &nbsp;<strong>In a Pedestal Combo the computer is housed in the <u>joystick/control panel</u> (like a GameBox). &nbsp;This allows the user to remove the joystick/control panel from the base and leave the base behind.</strong> &nbsp;The user can move the joystick/control panel to another room or another home and plug it directly into any HDTV. &nbsp;For all intents and purposes the Pedestal becomes a GameBox (read the GameBox section so understand the positives and negatives of a GameBox). &nbsp;This gives the Pedestal Combo a lot of versatility and portability. The down side is that they sound system is much smaller and the space in the cabinet is much smaller, making working on the computer quite tight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Pedestals:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li style="text-align:justify;">The 2-player Pedestal's dimensions are 36” W x 28” D x 39” H and the 4-player's is 48” W x 29” D x 39" &nbsp;H. &nbsp; While they are definitely smaller than an upright, they still have some weight to them and are awkward to move given the size and weight. &nbsp;Most people find to get them through a 30" door frame they need to remove the joystick/control panel or leave it attached and rotate it. &nbsp;Given the girth of a pedestal, it probably takes 2 people to comfortably move it (if you are going far).</li>
  <li style="text-align:justify;">The 2-player Pedestal weighs 80 pounds and the 4-player weighs 95.</li>
  <li style="text-align:justify;">Pedestals do not come with a TV, so the user must supply it. &nbsp; &nbsp;This allows the user to buy any TV they want and are not limited to a particular size like in an upright. &nbsp;While a Megacade's TV is limited to 43" for a 2-person and 50" for a 4-player, a Pedestal owner can connect it to a 65", 80" etc. &nbsp;Keep in mind the recommended viewing distances for large screen TV's if you are putting these in smaller rooms. &nbsp;For example, the recommended viewing distance for a 65" TV is 8.5' to 13' feet. &nbsp;The viewing distances for an 80" TV is 10' to 16.5'.</li>
  <li style="text-align:justify;">Because the user is supplying the TV, the user must also set up their display in Windows. EHA cannot do this for you. It is not difficult, but the user has to do it.</li>
  <li style="text-align:justify;">Another benefit of a Pedestal is that it is on wheels so a user can store it under a TV mounted to the wall and then when in use move it out to play it. &nbsp;This is helpful if the user is working with tight spaces. &nbsp; The wheels perform well on hard surfaces like wood and cement. They do not perform particularly well on carpet. They get the job done, but it is not easy. The wheels however can be upgraded easily by purchasing larger wheels/casters from Amazon. See <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PG4BZYG?ref=nb_sb_ss_w_as-reorder-t1_ypp_rep_k0_1_8&amp;amp=undefined&amp;crid=1A2W5A3P8L8LT&amp;sprefix=4%2Bcaster&amp;th=1">here</a></li>
  <li style="text-align:justify;">Like uprights, Pedestals have a quality sound system with subwoofer, accept headphones (and when the headship are being used they are quiet), &nbsp;have a PC and the computer hardware can be upgraded and replaced.</li>
  <li style="text-align:justify;">Pedestals can use a “battleship” joystick/control panel.</li>
  <li style="text-align:justify;">Pedestals can accommodate light guns. &nbsp;The only difference here is that since the TV does not come with the system EHA cannot set up your LEDs that go on the TV. &nbsp;Likewise, EHA cannot setup a Wii lightbar for you (if you purchase the Dolphin bar). &nbsp;You will need to do this yourself. Again, it is not hard, but must be done by the user.</li>
  <li style="text-align:justify;">Pedestals can accommodate the same external peripherals as the uprights including steering wheel/pedals, X-Box controllers, flight stick, guitar, dance pad, etc.</li>
  <li style="text-align:justify;">The wide 4-player play-field can accommodate 4-adult players.</li>
  <li style="text-align:justify;">Pedestals can accommodate a passive and/or active marquee (see photos below). &nbsp;They can either be mounted to the Pedestal or they can be mounted below or above the TV on the wall. &nbsp;If the marquee(s) are mounted on the wall above or below the TV there is no concern they will interfere with light guns or a wii.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Below are photos of a 2-player and 4-player Pedestals.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Pedestal Positives (versus other EHA machines):&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Lighter and easier to move than an upright (but still may take 2 people to move it very far).</li>
  <li>The user can select their own TV size, brand and type. This allows the user to select a TV much larger than what the uprights come with and allow further upgrades as new TV models and features come out.</li>
  <li>If the TV breaks or needs repairs technicians can easily get to it and/or it can be replaced.</li>
  <li>Pedestals come on wheels so they can be stored under a TV mounted on the wall and then brought out when it is being used.</li>
  <li>Plenty of room on the playing field for multiple people to play.</li>
  <li>Can accommodate an active or passive marquee. Multiple marquees can be installed on the machine and/or above or below the TV (so a third monitor is possible).</li>
  <li>Pedestals have some room for graphics on the cabinet (but not as much as an upright).</li>
  <li style="text-align:justify;">Pedestals can accommodate many external peripherals including steering wheel/pedals, flight stick, guitar, X-Box controllers, dance pad, etc. (the same as on the uprights).</li>
  <li style="text-align:justify;">Is less expensive than a Megacade, but the additional cost of a TV must be factored in.</li>
  <li style="text-align:justify;">If a user gets a Pedestal Combo, they can have both the advantages of a Pedestal and a GameBox including have a relatively “portable” machine that can be transported to other houses or locations.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Pedestals Negatives (versus other EHA machines):&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Pedestals are not all-in-one machines like an upright where everything comes with it, the user must supply the TV and there is the extra cost for this.</li>
  <li>The user must setup their TV/display in Windows, must install their LEDS on their TV for light guns and must install the Wii light bar for Wii controllers (if they buy these options).</li>
  <li>Pedestals have small cabinets so when you need to work in the cabinet on the computer, space is tight.</li>
  <li>The tight space in the cabinet has the potential to create heat concerns for the computer motherboard and graphic board (this can be solved for by additional fans or a cooling system if that occurs).</li>
  <li>If a passive or active marquee is placed on the Pedestal it has the potential to interfere with light guns or the Wii controllers. &nbsp;Alternatively they can be placed on wall to alleviate this concern or if mounted on the Pedestal they can be tilted back out of the way.</li>
</ul>

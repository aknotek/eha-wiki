<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="text-big">D. Peripheral Options</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>EHA gives users the option to buy peripherals from them. &nbsp;These are covered below including a few that EHA does not offer, but which you may want to consider.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>LIGHT GUNS</u></strong></p>
<p>Light guns are one of the most popular peripherals among EHA users. &nbsp; There are many light gun games on the EHA drives. &nbsp;Most of them support two players, so many users have two light guns. &nbsp;This allows users to go head-to-head with each other.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Light guns come in two main varieties, one with recoil and one without recoil. &nbsp; Light guns with recoil recreate a force feedback and the kick reminiscent of a real gun. &nbsp;A light gun with recoil typically has 2 cords, one that connects power to the recoil feature and one that connects it to the computer. &nbsp;Light guns without recoil still &nbsp;have a light “rumble ” to them when trigger is pressed (it shakes a little). &nbsp;Some users really like the stronger recoil feature, while others find it makes their hand tired during prolong use. &nbsp;Some light guns allow you to turn off the force feedback feature on a recoil gun. &nbsp;Light guns with recoil cost more than guns without it. &nbsp; It is a personal choice whether your light gun has recoil or not.</p>
<p>There are 3 main light gun options available for EHA machines: Aimtrak, Gun4IR, and Sinden.&nbsp;They are covered below.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>It is recommended you buy your light gun(s) from or in conjunction with EHA when you purchase your system so EHA can set it up for you.</u></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Aimtrak</strong> -</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:54.41%;"><img src="/aimtrack_gunblue.jpg"></figure>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aimtrak guns are the official EHA light gun. &nbsp;You can get them in recoil and non-recoil. &nbsp;You can order one or two guns from EHA's website. &nbsp;If you order lights funs from EHA, this is what you will get. &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong><u>Many in the EHA community have purchased these guns, only to be disappointed and frustrated with them</u></strong>. &nbsp;They have one sensor bar and while a few people get them to consistently work accurately and acceptably, many find that these guns just do not &nbsp;work well. If you search the EHA Owners Unite Facebook site you will see a lot posts on this. <strong>Many users eventually upgrade to either Gun4IR or Sinden. &nbsp;Either of these options is worth the investment and is highly recommended both in order to save you money in the end and spare you frustration.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Gun4IR</strong> -</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:60.4%;"><img src="/gun4ir.jpg"></figure>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;Gun4IR is another light gun type. This is an open source product. &nbsp;<a href="https://rpegelectronics.com/">RPEG Electronics</a> sells these guns on their website. They are roughly twice as expensive as Aimtrak's but many users will say they are absolutely worth the extra cost and that in this instance you get what you pay for. &nbsp;The LEDs for Gun4IR go on the top, bottom, left and right of your TV screen. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">RPEG Electronics also services Gun4IR and assists users in setting up their systems. &nbsp;RPEG electronics can convert Aimtrak guns to Gun4IR. There are many gun styles for Gun4IR. &nbsp;<strong><u>If you decide to go with Gun4IR (highly recommended), you must contact RPEG Electronics, select what you want and pay for your gun.</u></strong> RPEG Electronics will then send your guns to EHA for installation. &nbsp;Gun4IR requires a license fee. &nbsp;EHA will purchase the license for you and charge it back to you - it is not expensive. &nbsp;Gun4IR light guns work on EHA's Light Gun wheel in Big Box with no modification. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is highly recommended you go through this process and have EHA install your guns and go through the setup to the extent they can. &nbsp;EHA can completely setup Gun4IR on all uprights and Table Tops. &nbsp;For Pedestals and GameBoxes EHA can do some of the setup, but you will have to install the LEDs on your TV (RPEG Electronics will help you with this).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sinden</strong> -&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/lightguns/sinden_light_guns.jpg"></figure>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sinden guns are a quality light gun, but they are often on backorder for months. &nbsp;There is a separate wheel in Big Box for playing Sinden Light gun games. &nbsp;Sinden's website can be found <a href="https://www.sindenlightgun.com/">here</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>WIRELESS X-BOX ONE CONTROLLERS WITH WIRELESS TRANSMITTER</u></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/wirelessanalogcontrollers/xbox_wireless_controller.jpg"></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On EHA's website you can order your machine with X- Box One controller(s). &nbsp; &nbsp;If you do not have a transmitter you will need that as well. &nbsp;If you have your own X-Box One controllers you can purchase just the transmitter from EHA. If you have a 4-person EHA machine (and you do not have X-Box One controllers or a transmitter) and you want to play 4-players with your controllers, you may want to &nbsp;purchase 2, two-Xbox One Controllers (with 1 transmitter). &nbsp;Some console games <strong><u>require</u></strong> an X-Box controller and some users prefer an X-Box controller over the joystick/control panel. &nbsp;X-Box controllers work with X-Box, PlayStation and other console games.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Because some games require an analog controller it is highly recommended you purchase and/or have an X-Box controller for your EHA machine at some point.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>STEERING WHEEL/ PEDALS</u></strong></p>
<p>EHA sells a high quality steering wheel/pedal on their website. &nbsp;There are many great racing games on Omega that will use this setup. &nbsp;<strong>That said, you do not have to buy this with your initial purchase and you can either buy this from EHA or from another place anytime you are ready.</strong> Thrustmaster steering wheel/pedals models that work with PC games typically work well. &nbsp;Most Thrustmaster models will clamp to your joystick/control panel. &nbsp;However, a steering wheel stand, compatible with your Thrustmaster steering wheel is recommended. They are usually less than $100 on Amazon or Ebay. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Wii CONTROLLERS</u></strong></p>
<p>EHA sells a 2-player Wii controller with DolphinBar package. &nbsp;It is a high quality system that works well. &nbsp;It includes zappers, (guns) steering wheel, cases, nunchucks and dolphinbar. This is recommended. &nbsp;There are many high quality Wii games to play on the system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>OTHER PERIPHERALS&nbsp;</u></strong></p>
<p>These peripherals are not on EHA's website but can be added at anytime on Amazon or Ebay.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>XBox 360 Guitar for Guitar Hero and Guitar Clone</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Guitar Clone is a game on Omega like Guitar Hero. &nbsp;An XBox 360 guitar (wired or wireless) work well and needs little if no modification to work. &nbsp;You can buy used ones at garages sales or on E-Bay or new ones on Amazon. &nbsp;Wii-guitars for the Wii version of these games also work.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/wii/guitar.jpg"></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Dance Pad&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>A dance pad is another peripheral not offered by EHA. &nbsp;You can however order one yourself. This is a good quality metal DDR dance pad. &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.maty-taneczne.pl/shop/dance-mat-ex-pro-metal-black/">https://www.maty-taneczne.pl/shop/dance-mat-ex-pro-metal-black/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Flight Stick (External)</strong></p>
<p>If you decide to try an external flight stick instead of the Tron/flight stick this Thrustmaster T-Flight HOTAS One for PC is recommended.. &nbsp;See <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Thrustmaster-T-Flight-Hotas-One-xbox/dp/B07643TW2V/ref=sr_1_4?crid=35V0AUMTHZGBZ&amp;keywords=thrustmaster+hotas&amp;qid=1660268923&amp;sprefix=thrustmaster+hotas%2Caps%2C117&amp;sr=8-4">here.</a></p>

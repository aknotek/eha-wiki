<p><span class="text-big"><strong>7. Stealth</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stealth machines have the same basic size, weight and features of the Classic. &nbsp;The cabinet geometry is little more severe in terms of angles, but otherwise, the features are the same as the Classic (see the Classic section for details). The exception is that there is no drawer option in the front of Stealth cabinets.</p>

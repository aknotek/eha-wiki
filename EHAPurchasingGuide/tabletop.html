<p><span class="text-big"><strong>9. Table Top</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Table Top machines come standard in a 1 or 2-player version (a 4-player version is possible). &nbsp;They are smaller than the uprights and pedestals and they are an all-in-one system. &nbsp;They are less expensive than uprights and pedestals as well. &nbsp;The weight is not as much either and the go through doors easier. They of course, still play exactly the same games and have the same computer hardware as other EHA systems.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Below is an overview of Table Tops. &nbsp;In addition, their positives and negatives (compared against other EHA machines) are covered in this section.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Table Tops:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li style="text-align:justify;">They are smaller machines than the uprights at 27"W X 20"D X 32"H and sit on a table (see photos below). &nbsp;While still a little heavy the fact that they can sit on a table makes them movable and somewhat “portable.” They will also go through a 30" door frame with no problem.</li>
  <li style="text-align:justify;">They weigh 80 pounds.</li>
  <li style="text-align:justify;">They come in a standard 1 or 2-person version.</li>
  <li style="text-align:justify;">The machine comes was a 27" 1080p monitor.</li>
  <li style="text-align:justify;">The machine comes with a good sound system and subwoofer (mounted in the top of the machine) and accepts headphones. &nbsp;When the headphones are being used the machine is very quiet. The joysticks and buttons make very little noise.</li>
  <li style="text-align:justify;">Like any PC, it's computer hardware can be upgraded and replaced.</li>
  <li style="text-align:justify;">Table Tops can accommodate light guns. &nbsp;It is best, if possible, to get your light guns from EHA when the Table Top is purchased. &nbsp;<strong>They can set everything up for you (this is the way to go)</strong>. &nbsp;This is particularly true if you want high quality light guns like Gun4IR (highly recommended &nbsp;- Sindens are also a good light gun - see the light gun section in this guide for more details). &nbsp;The reason you want EHA to set everything up, among other things, is that the Gun4IR's LEDs for a Table Top , if possible, should go behind the glass that is in front of the TV. EHA can easily do this when they are building your machine. &nbsp;You can do it later, after you bring it home, but it is challenging. Having them do it right, at the “factory”, makes the most sense.</li>
  <li style="text-align:justify;">Table Tops can accommodate many external peripherals including steering wheel/pedals, X-Box controllers, Tron/flight stick, guitar, dance pad, etc. &nbsp;The Tron/flight stick does obscure some of the TV monitor.</li>
  <li style="text-align:justify;">Table Tops can accommodate a passive or active marquee.</li>
  <li style="text-align:justify;">Table Tops come standard with flipper buttons on the side.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Below are photos of several table tops.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Table Top Positives (versus other EHA machines):&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Lighter and easier to move (but still may take 2 people to move it very far).</li>
  <li>Fairly “portable” since it can sit on any table.</li>
  <li>All-in-one system.</li>
  <li>EHA can setup everything on your Table Top machine and it can come completely ready for you to play when it arrives (not so with Pedestals and GameBoxes - the user will have work to do to finish the setup).</li>
  <li>Can accommodate an active or passive marquee.</li>
  <li>Pedestals have some room for graphics on the cabinet (but not as much as an upright).</li>
  <li>Plays all of the same games as uprights and pedestals.</li>
  <li>Are less expensive than other EHA machines (except GameBoxes).</li>
  <li style="text-align:justify;">Table Tops can accommodate many external peripherals including steering wheel/pedals, flight stick, guitar, X-Box controllers, dance pad, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Table Top Negatives (versus other EHA machines):&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Do not come in a 4-person model.</li>
  <li>Table Top TVs are 27" so they are smallest TV in the EHA series of machines.</li>
  <li>Table Tops have small cabinets so when you need to work in the cabinet on the computer space is tight.</li>
  <li>The tight space in the cabinet as the potential to create heat concerns for the computer motherboard and graphic board (this can be solved for by additional fans or a cooling system if that occurs).</li>
  <li>A Tron/flight stick can block some of the viewing screen.</li>
  <li>While active marquees are great and a Table Top can accommodate them, you have to be prepared to support them when there are problems.</li>
  <li>Because the TV sits behind glass it can be difficult to add LEDs for light guns like Gun4 IR.</li>
  <li>Because the TV is built into the machine, if it needs to replaced (unlikely, but possible), it would be difficult.</li>
</ul>

<h1>What Is It?</h1>
<p>Omega is the combined frontend and backend running the gaming experience. &nbsp;The EHA systems run emulation for various consoles and arcades. &nbsp;The frontend experience runs Launchbox. &nbsp;The backend or the individual emulators running various consoles, portables, and arcade games all use different emulators. &nbsp;Previous versions of the drives ran Hyperspin as its frontend with Rocketlauncher as its backend. &nbsp;Launchbox is actively being developed, enhanced, and supported by the community and requires a $75 license to run in what's called Bigbox mode. &nbsp;It's the pretty frontend everyone primarily uses.</p>

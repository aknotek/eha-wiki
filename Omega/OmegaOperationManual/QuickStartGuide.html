<p><span class="text-big"><strong>Omega Quick Start Guide</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Quick Start Guide is for fast learners, and &nbsp;people who do not like user’s manuals and just want to dive in)! &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To receive your machine from the shipping company, unpack it, and move it into your residence, please see those sections later in this manual.&nbsp; This Quick Start Guide presumes you have your machine in a safe location, have plugged it in and the machine has electrical power.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">NOTE: &nbsp;EHA supports several different button sequences depending on your machine:</p>
<ul>
  <li style="text-align:justify;">2 player EHA machines and older 4-player EHA machines - [Shift] Key is Player 1's Start Button.</li>
  <li style="text-align:justify;">KEYWIZ - If your EHA machine has a KEYWIZ your [Shift] key on your joystick panel is the “Shazaam” button.</li>
  <li style="text-align:justify;">Newer (after 6/2022) EHA 4-player machines (IPAC4) - Your [Shift] key is Player 3's 7th button (i.e., Player 3 - 4th button from the left top).</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Turning On Your Machine:</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
  <li><strong><u>Uprights</u></strong> (MegaCade, Classic, Stealth) – The power button is located <strong>on top of the machine</strong> (upper left or right top of machine). It is a standard arcade push button (typically black). Push it, and it will turn on your machine.</li>
  <li><strong><u>Tabletops</u></strong> – The power button is located on the <strong>back center portion of the cabinet</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong><u>Pedestals&nbsp;</u></strong>– The power button is located on the <strong>back of the machine, near the center of the pedestal cabinet, opposite the HDMI port</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2. &nbsp;Loading a Game:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>After you turn on your machine, an introduction video will automatically load. <strong><u>Allow the video to run for 30 seconds (this allows the system to fully load).</u></strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;After 30 seconds, push any button or push any position on any joystick to skip the introduction video. You will be at the Big Box main wheel.</li>
  <li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>You can move down the Big Box wheel by pressing Player 1's Joystick down</strong>.&nbsp;Alternatively, you can <strong>move up the Big Box wheel by pressing the Player 1's Joystick up</strong>.</li>
  <li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Use Player 1's Joystick to go to ARCADE CLASSICS on the Big Box main wheel.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Press Player 1’s START Button (a white or black man icon button)&nbsp;to select ARCADE CLASSICS.&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>You will then be in the Arcade Classics Wheel (menu).</li>
  <li><strong>Load any game in ARCADE CLASSICS by pressing Player 1’s START Button</strong>.&nbsp; For example, you could push Player 1’s Joystick up or down to navigate to the game “Batman Forever,” then press Player 1’s START Button to load the game.&nbsp; Alternatively, you can press Player 1’s Joystick left or right to scroll through the alphabet to the letter B and then press Player 1’s Joystick down until you come to Batman Forever (and then press Player 1’s START Button to load the game).</li>
  <li>Wait for the game to load.&nbsp; When the game is fully loaded (this could take a few minutes), <strong>credit the game by pressing the Credit Button (also called the coin button, typically it looks like a dollar sign - $. ).&nbsp; </strong>You can do this multiple times.&nbsp; If you loaded Batman Forever, push the Credit Button four times. &nbsp;This also works for Players 2, 3 and 4’s credit button.</li>
  <li><strong>Press 1 (2, 3, or 4) Player’s START Button to start a 1 player or multiplayer game. &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>If you loaded Batman Forever, press Player 1’s START Button and then press Player 2’s START Button to select a two-player game.&nbsp; Press Player 1 and 2’s START Buttons again to start the game.</li>
  <li><strong>To exit any game at any time <u>Press and HOLD Player 1’s START Button/OR your [SHIFT] Button and simultaneously push Player 2’s START Button.</u></strong><u>&nbsp;</u>&nbsp;(Note: do not try at first at least to push them at the same time, first HOLD Player’s Start Button then simultaneously Press Player 2’s START Button).&nbsp; &nbsp;For example, if you played Batman Forever, Press and HOLD Player 1’s START Button and simultaneously push Player 2’s START Button.&nbsp; &nbsp;This will take you back to Arcade Classics wheel.&nbsp; &nbsp;To go back to the Big Box Main Wheel Press and HOLD Player 1’s START Button and simultaneously push Player 2’s START Button. &nbsp; Note: In the Big Box menu system press Player 1’s START Button to go forward in the menus and press and HOLD Player 1’s START button/OR your [SHIFT] Button and simultaneously push Player 2’s START button to go backwards in the Big Box menu system.</li>

Then, once again, Hold Player 1’s START button/OR your [SHIFT] Button and simultaneously push Player 2’s START button.&nbsp; </strong>This will take you to the “Big Box Unified” screen.&nbsp; <strong>Use Player 1’s Joystick to point to Exit and then press Player 1’s START Button to select it.&nbsp; </strong>This will exit you out of Big Box and take you to the Windows Desktop.</li>

<p><span class="text-big"><strong>Welcome/Thank you</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thank you for purchasing an Extreme Home Arcades machine!&nbsp; Our mission is to provide you the ultimate arcade experience at home.&nbsp; We hope you will get many years of fun and use from your Extreme Home Arcades machine.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We use high-quality materials in each of our builds and each machine is built entirely in our shop.&nbsp; We deliver an all-in-one system that includes custom hardware and software.&nbsp; Extreme Home Arcades machines are quite complex.&nbsp; Because of this complexity, and because they can run so many games (tens of thousands) the machines are not always “plug and play.”&nbsp; Some people refer to games systems like this “as a hobby,” as opposed to just plugging them in and playing them.&nbsp; As a “hobby,” to get the full use of your machine, there were will be a learning curve.&nbsp; This manual is intended to help shorten the learning curve and help you get as much out of your machine as possible.&nbsp; That said, there are many games that are truly “plug and play,” while others will require tinkering and trial and error methods to get the full use of them.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A good resource you may want to take advantage of is the Extreme Home Arcades Owners Unite! Facebook page.&nbsp; This is a private user’s group site that is not sanctioned by or officially affiliated with Extreme Home Arcades.&nbsp; They are simply owners of Extreme Home Arcades machines, that share information and help one another. They are an excellent source of information and support for anyone that owns and uses an Extreme Home Arcades machine.&nbsp; &nbsp; Another great source of information regarding Extreme Home Arcades machines is&nbsp; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">www.Youtube.com</a>.&nbsp; A search of Extreme Home Arcades on Youtube will result in may videos designed to help you learn and use your machines.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At Extreme Home Arcades, we are here to support you.&nbsp; If we can do anything to help you with your machine, please just contact us and let us know.&nbsp; Another way we support our machines is to offer you free lifetime software updates.&nbsp;This is covered in detail later in this manual, but the short is that all you have to do is mail us your hard drive and we install the new software on it and mail it back to you (you pay the shipping) and instantly you get new games and enhancements to your system.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We hope you enjoy your machine and once again, thank you for purchasing a product from Extreme Home Arcades.&nbsp;We greatly appreciate your business!</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>David Lewis</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><mark class="marker-yellow"><strong>An important thing to keep in mind is that &nbsp;to use a wireless analog controller in Omega the user MUST TURN IT ON AND HAVE IT SYNCED <u>BEFORE</u> THE GAME IS LOADED. &nbsp;If it is synced after the game is loaded it will not work.</strong></mark></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You can map games to a wireless analog controller like an Xbox 1, Xbox 360 or similar controller.&nbsp; Some emulators like Nintendo 64, &nbsp;PlayStation 2, Play Station Portable (PSP), Nintendo GameCube, Dreamcast and many new PC games <strong><u>require</u></strong> an analog controller.&nbsp; That is, the controls on your arcade machine will not work on these emulators.&nbsp; You can also set up a wireless analog controller to work with MAME (Arcade Classic) games.&nbsp; &nbsp; Most wireless analog controllers are plug and play so all you have to do it turn them.&nbsp;If you have 2 of them, one will be player 1’s controller and one will be player 2’s controller.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Syncing/Pairing an Xbox Wireless Controller</strong></p>
<p>Syncing an Xbox controller to your Extreme Home Arcades machine is straightforward.&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li>If you want to start completely from scratch, find where your Xbox dongle is plugged into the USB port in your arcade machine and then unplug it.</li>
  <li>Then, plug it back into the USB port.</li>
  <li>Push the button on the Xbox Dongle until a light on the dongle starts to blink and then let go.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Next, take an Xbox controller and push the “ON” button (which is the lighted X button in the center of the controller – see photo).&nbsp;The Xbox controller will automatically start trying to sync.&nbsp; When the “ON” button the Xbox controller stops blinking, the controller is synced.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>If you have multiple controllers, press the “ON” button for them as well to sync them. That’s it.</li>
  <li>If you controller does not sync, always check the batteries.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Mapping a Wireless Analog Controller to MAME (Arcade Classic) Games</strong></p>
<p>Follow the instruction below to map a MAME (Arcade Classic) game to an Xbox controller.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Turn on your wireless analog controller (Xbox controller).</li>
  <li>At the Big Box Main Wheel, navigate with P1’s Joystick to the ARCADE (Arcade Classics) wheel.</li>
  <li>Push P1’s START Button to enter the ARCADE Wheel.</li>
  <li>Navigate to “Green Beret - Rush'n Attack” and Push P1’s START Button.&nbsp;Green Beret will be loaded.</li>
  <li>Credit the game by Pushing the CREDIT Button.</li>
  <li>Push P1’s START Button to start the game.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>To pause the game <strong>HOLD P1’s START button and press P1’s Joystick DOWN</strong>. The game should now be paused.&nbsp; You can now access the Player Menu for Green Beret without the game playing.&nbsp;</li>
  <li><strong>HOLD P1’s START Button and press P1’s Joystick RIGHT</strong>.&nbsp;This will bring up the Player Menu.</li>
  <li>Navigate with P1’s Joystick to “<strong><u>Input (this Machine)</u></strong>” and then Push P1’s START Button.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>This will bring up the mapping controls for the game.</li>
  <li>You will modify the game’s controls to use a wireless analog controller (Xbox).&nbsp;<strong>Before making any changes, take a photo of the controls as there before any modifications just in case something would go wrong – you will know where you started.</strong></li>
  <li>Use P1’s Joystick to go to “P1 Up” and then press P1’s START Button to clear it.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Next, press up on the DPAD on your wireless analog controller (this pad in the lower left of the controller). See photo.</li>
  <li>Do the same thing for “P1 Down,” “P1 Left” “P1 Right”</li>
  <li>&nbsp;Go to “P1 Button 1”, press P1’s START Button to clear it and then push a button on the wireless analog controller of your choosing. Do the same thing for “P1 Button 2,”.</li>
  <li>Go to “Return to Previous Menu” and press P1’s START Button.</li>
  <li>Go to “Return to Machine” and press P1’s START Button.</li>
</ol>
<p>To unpause the game&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>HOLD P1’s START button and press P1’s Joystick DOWN</strong></p>
<p>. The game should now be live. That’s it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Mapping a Wireless Analog Controller in TeknoParrot</strong></p>
<p>Turn on your analog controller (such as an Xbox controller).&nbsp; Sometimes it is helpful to play an analog controller game (like PlayStation 2 game first, before mapping a device to TeknoParrot – this allows your arcade machine to easily recognize the device).</p>
<ol>
  <li>In this example we will map an Xbox controller to the TeknoParrot game, Raiden IV.</li>
  <li>Exit Big Box by HOLDING Player 1's START Button/[SHIFT] Button and simultaneously Press Player 2's START Button.</li>
  <li>Use the Track ball to point to the TeknoParrot icon on the Task Bar (at the very bottom of the screen). The TeknoParrot icon looks like a red parrot (if you hover over it – it says – TeknoParrotUI).&nbsp; Click on the TeknoParrot icon with the left AUX mouse button (with the AUX toggle switch being to the right) to open the TechnoParrot User Interface.</li>
  <li>Click on “Raiden IV.”&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Then, click on “GAME SETTINGS.” This will allow you to make some general changes to the game.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>For mapping an analog control, you want the input to be “<strong>Xinput</strong>.”&nbsp; If the “General -Input API” is not “Xinput,” then click on down arrow and change it to this. See photo.</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;7. If you made a change on the GAME SETTINGS screen, then click on “Save Settings.” If you did not make a change, click on “Back.”</p>
<p>8. Now, click on “CONTROLLER SETUP.” You will now setup the game for your analog controller.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>9. Use the trackball as a mouse (and the Aux buttons) to click on the line next to “Coin 1.” When you click on it - it will clear the current selection.&nbsp; Now, you can either click on Player 1’s Credit Button for example or you can select a button on your analog controller.&nbsp; it is completely up to you.&nbsp; The photo shows “Input Device 0 Y” which is a button on the user’s analog controller.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>10. Click on the line next to “Start.”&nbsp; Again, this will clear the current selection.&nbsp; Now, you can either click on Player 1’s START Button for example or you can select a button on your analog controller.&nbsp;</p>
<p>11. Click on the line next to “Player 1 Up.” This will clear the current selection.&nbsp; <strong>Press your left stick on your analog controller UP.</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;The screen should now say something like “Input Devie 0 LeftThumbInput Device 0 y+” (see photo).&nbsp;</p>
<p>12. Do the same thing (designate the corresponding left stick on your analog controller” for “Player 1 Down,” “Player 1 Left,” and “Player 1 Right.”</p>
<p>13. In like manner, designate a button on your analog controller for “Player 1 Shoot” (fire button) and “Player 1 Bomb.”</p>
<p>14. THEN, CLICK ON SAVE SETTINGS (don’t click on “back” or you will lose everything you just did).</p>
<p>15. Click on “LAUNCH GAME” to load Raiden IV and test out your controller setup. &nbsp;After you have tested your setup, exit Raiden IV by HOLDING Player 1's START Button/[SHIFT] Button and simultaneously Press Player 2's START Button.</p>
<p>16. &nbsp;Close the “TecknoParrot UI” Window (by clicking on the red X in the upper right corner of the window).&nbsp;</p>
<p>17. To go back to Big Box, click on the Big Box icon on the task bar or the Big Box Icon on the Windows Desktop (if you have a Marquee).&nbsp;</p>

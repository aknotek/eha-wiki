<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Loading LaunchBox</strong></p>
<p>To load LaunchBox exit Big Box and then wait 30 seconds (see below). After that, double-click on the “LaunchBox” icon on the Windows Desktop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Loading LaunchBox Directly After Big Box</strong></p>
<p><mark class="marker-yellow"><strong>If you leave Big Box and then want to load LaunchBox directly thereafter, wait for 30 seconds before loading LaunchBox. &nbsp;If you do not, several things can happen: 1) &nbsp;you are likely to get an error from LaunchBox saying that a version of LaunchBox/Big Box is already running and 2) you are likely to corrupt some of the load files and then it will not load. &nbsp;Waiting for a few seconds between moving from each can avoid these issues.</strong></mark></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>LaunchBox Tutorials</strong></p>
<p>When you load LaunchBox for the first few times a “Welcome to LaunchBox” screen is shown (see screenshot). &nbsp;A great way to learn LaunchBox and Big Box is to watch the videos under “Tutorial." &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>LaunchBox &nbsp;- Getting Started - Correcting A Start Up Issue in Dragon's Lair</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you load LaunchBox, notice that your “wheels” or “menus" in Omega are displayed vertically on the left side of the screen. &nbsp; In this example, we will show you how to make a change to Dragon's Lair's start up so it loads correctly.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Click on the “Daphne” wheel (see screenshoot)</li>
  <li>Click on the game “Dragon's Lair” (it is a Daphne game - see screenshot).</li>
  <li>Notice in the screenshot you can “Edit” the game's setting or “Play” the game straight from LaunchBox.</li>
  <li>Click on “Edit.”</li>
</ol>
<figure class="image"><img src="/launchbox/launchboxdragonlair1.png"></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. The settings screen for “Dragon's Lair” is displayed. &nbsp;On the left side of the screen click on “Startup/Pause" (see screenshot below).</p>
<p>6. Click on the box next to &nbsp;“Overrride Default Startup Screen Settings" and then click on “Customize…”</p>
<p>7. The “Startup/Pause” screen is displayed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>8. Make sure “Enable Game Shutdown Screen" and “Aggressive Startup Window Hiding" &nbsp;boxes are checked. &nbsp;</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;Then, click on “OK” &nbsp;and then click on “OK”.</p>
<p>10. &nbsp;Now, while “Daphne” is still selected click on “Dragon's Lair” again and then click on “Play" to test the game.</p>
<p>11. In “Dragon's Lair” press Player 1's “Credit” button several times (it sometimes takes 10-15 seconds for it to register). &nbsp;Then, click on Player 1's “START” button to start the game.</p>
<p>12. When the game is over press Player 1's START/SHIFT Key and simultaneously press Player 2's START Button. This will take you back to LaunchBox.</p>
<p>13. To close “LaunchBox” click on “X” in the upper right of the LaunchBox screen. &nbsp; You should now be back at the Windows desktop.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Backing Up Omega Files in LaunchBox/Big Box</strong></p>
<p>From time to time you should backup your Omega files in LaunchBox/Big Box. &nbsp;It is easy to do. &nbsp;This will back up the following (among other things):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Your LaunchBox/Big Box settings with license</li>
  <li>Your Gun4IR for settings with license</li>
  <li>Your LED Blinky settings with license</li>
  <li>Your favorites</li>
  <li>Your MAME settings and high scores</li>
  <li>Your start-up and marquee video(s)</li>
</ul>
<p>This will not backup all the games on Omega. It will just backup your Omega Settings and various other Omega files it needs (see above).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To backup your Omega settings:</p>
<ol>
  <li>In LaunchBox, click on “TOOLS” and then on “ Omega Settings” (see screenshot). Alternatively, in Big Box at the "Big Box Unified" screen &nbsp;click on “Omega Settings.”</li>
</ol>
<figure class="image"><img src="/launchbox/launchbox_omegs_settings_backup.png">

</figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;At the Omega Settings screen (see screenshot) use Player 1's Joystick to select “Backup Omega Content” &nbsp;and then Press Player 1's START Button to select it.</p>

</figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Next, select where you would like the Omega Backup files to be stored (see screenshot). &nbsp;In the screenshot below the Omega Backup folders is stored in: "Users/Administrator/LaunchBox/Backups." &nbsp;After clicking on “Select Folder” the files will then be backed up. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/launchbox/launchbox_omegs_settings_backup3.png">

</figure>
<p>4. To restore your Omega Backup, at the Omega Settings screen, navigate to “Import Omega Backup" (see previous screenshot) and press Player 1's START Button. &nbsp; Select where the Omega Backup folder is and click on “Select Folder.” Your Omega Backup should now be installed.</p>
<p>5. To exit, navigate to “Apply Settings and Exit” and press Player 1's START Button.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="text-big"><strong>Backing Up and Restoring XML Data Files</strong></span></p>
<p>See the following <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGZen3vLRUI&amp;t=6s">video</a> regarding backup and restoring LaunchBox XML files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Occasionally you may get an error message that says a launchbox.XML file is corrupt. &nbsp;If this occurs LaunchBox/Big Box will not load. &nbsp;This section will explain how to make sure LaunchBox is automatically creating backup files, manually create backup files and how to restore both manual and automatic backup files. &nbsp; Note: this section shows you how to backup and restore your Launchbox.xml files not how to back up your full Omega drive.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Exit out of Big Box and go to the Windows Desktop. Double click on the “LaunchBox” icon.</li>
  <li>At the LaunchBox main menu (see screenshot below) click on “TOOLS” &nbsp;(in the upper right of the screen). Then, click on “Options…” (see screenshot).</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/launchbox/launchboxbackuprestore1.png">
  <figcaption>LaunchBox Options</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. The “Options” screen is displayed (see screenshot). &nbsp;Under “Data” click on “Backups." &nbsp;The “Backups” screen is displayed (see screenshot). &nbsp;Notice that the box is checked for “Automatically back up the LaunchBox XML data files (recommended). ” &nbsp; &nbsp;You want to make sure &nbsp;this box is checked and that LaunchBox is automatically backing up LaunchBox's XML files every time LaunchBox/Big Box is started and shutdown. &nbsp; Click on “Ok” to close the “Options” screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/launchbox/launchboxbackuprestore2revised.png">
  <figcaption>LaunchBox - Automatic XML Data Files Backup</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;You will now create a manual backup of your LaunchBox XML files. &nbsp; At the LaunchBox main menu click on “Tools,” “ File Management,” and then on “Create Data Backup…” (see &nbsp;screenshot and red circles). &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/launchbox/launchboxbackuprestore3.png">
  <figcaption>LaunchBox - Tools - File Management</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;The “Browse for New Data Backup File” screen is displayed (see screenshot). &nbsp;Notice that the file name says “Custom LaunchBox Data Backup [date]”. &nbsp;This is custom backup as opposed to an automatic backup. &nbsp;Notice in the screenshot below the yellow box that shows a number of “Automatic Big Box Shutdown Data Backup” files and “Automatic Big Box Startup Data Backup” files. &nbsp; Click on “Save” to save this custom backup file. &nbsp; &nbsp;LaunchBox saves the files and then puts you back at the LaunchBox main menu.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/launchbox/launchboxbackuprestore4_revised.png">
  <figcaption>LaunchBox XML File Backup</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. You will now learn to restore a custom and/or automatic Big Box. &nbsp; Click on “TOOLS," “File Management,” “Restore Data Backup…” (see yellow circle in the 2nd screenshot above). &nbsp; The “Browse for Data Backup File to Restore” screen is displayed (see screenshot). &nbsp;The user would click on the backup they want to restore and the file name is automatically displayed next to “File name:" (see red rectangles). &nbsp;Then, click on “Open.” &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/launchbox/launchboxbackuprestore5.png">
  <figcaption>LaunchBox Restore XML Files</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;LaunchBox displays the dialogue box below (see screenshot). &nbsp;Click on “Yes” to restore the backup XML files. &nbsp; &nbsp;LaunchBox will restart. &nbsp;All of the files are restored.</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/launchbox/launchboxbackuprestore6.png">
  <figcaption>LaunchBox Restore XML Files</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>8. &nbsp; This method works fine unless you are working with corrupt XML files and you cannot load LaunchBox. &nbsp;If you cannot load LaunchBox do the following.</p>
<p>9. Load File Explorer and then navigate to Administrator/LaunchBox/Backups (see screenshot).</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/launchbox/launchboxbackuprestore7.png">
  <figcaption>LaunchBox Restoring XML Backups</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>10. &nbsp;In the directory Administrator/LaunchBox/Backups&nbsp;<strong><u> right</u></strong> click on the backup file you want to restore. &nbsp;Click on “7-Zip” and then on “Extract to [file name] (see screenshot). &nbsp;</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/launchbox/launchboxbackuprestore8.png">
  <figcaption>LaunchBox Restore XML Files</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>11. &nbsp;This will extract the files to its own subfolder (see screenshots below). &nbsp;</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/launchbox/launchboxbackuprestore9.png">
  <figcaption>LaunchBox Restore XML Files</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>12. Click on the folder that was just created and notice the XML files and Platform and Playlists folders/files in the red box in the screenshot. &nbsp;These are the file needed to get Big Box up and running again. &nbsp;</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="/launchbox/launchboxbackuprestore10.png">
  <figcaption>LaunchBox Restore XML Files</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>13. &nbsp;Move the File Explorer window with the files to be restored to the right and then open another File Explorer window (to the left) and navigate to: <strong><u>Administrator/Launchbox/Data</u></strong>. &nbsp;Click and highlight all the files in the backup directory and then right click and copy them and then paste them into the Administrator/Launchbox/Data directory. &nbsp;Click “Replace the files in the destination." &nbsp;You are now done. &nbsp; You have restored the backup files to the Data directory. Close the File Explorer windows and then load Big Box. &nbsp;Big Box should now load correctly. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="text-big"><strong>Wiki Editing Guide</strong></span></p>
<p>This is a quick guide to help you make edits to pages in this wikki, add pages to the wikki, add photos and link to the wikki, etc. &nbsp;Hopefully, it will help you get started to using the wikki.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another good source to learning this particular wikki (Wikki js) is on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjOfL_mMWk4">Youtube</a>. &nbsp;This is &nbsp;roughly a 17 minute video,. The author does a good job of explaining and showing how to do basic functions in wikki js.</p>

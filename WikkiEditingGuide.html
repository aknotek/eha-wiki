<p><span class="text-big"><strong>Wiki Editing Guide</strong></span></p>
<p>This is a quick guide to help you make edits to pages in this wikki, add pages to the wikki, add photos and link to the wikki, etc. &nbsp;Hopefully, it will help you get started to using the wikki.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another good source to learning this particular wikki (Wikki js) is on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjOfL_mMWk4">Youtube</a>. &nbsp;This is &nbsp;roughly a 17 minute video,. The author does a good job of explaining and showing how to do basic functions in wikki js.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you edit any of the pages on the EHA wikis please keep the following in mind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li><mark class="marker-yellow"><strong>PLEASE ASSUME YOUR READER HAS <u>NO EHA EXPERIENCE </u>(this will be the case for all EHA new users).</strong></mark></li>
  <li>To extent the you can, <mark class="marker-blue"><strong>please use screenshots, photos and graphics to clearly illustrate your instructions.</strong></mark> &nbsp;A picture is worth a thousand words &nbsp;and that is particularly true here. &nbsp;Please make your instructions as user-friendly as possible. &nbsp;A simple way to annotate your screenshots is to use the â€œPrtScn" key on your keyboard to capture a screenshot and then load Microsoft Paint and paste your screenshot into Paint. &nbsp;Once in Paint you can easily crop it, add words and other annotations to it. You can then save it and then load it into the wiki (see later in this guide on how to do that). &nbsp;</li>
  <li>To the extent you can, itemize your steps - 1, 2, 3, etc.</li>
  <li>Please double-check you work. :)</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you and happy editing!</p>

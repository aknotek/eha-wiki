<p><span class="text-big"><strong>Wiki Editing Guide</strong></span></p>
<p>This is a quick guide to help you make edits to pages in this wikki, add pages to the wikki, add photos and link to the wikki, etc. &nbsp;Hopefully, it will help you get started to using the wikki.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another good source to learning this particular wikki (Wikki js) is on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjOfL_mMWk4">Youtube</a>. &nbsp;This is &nbsp;roughly a 17 minute video,. The author does a good job of explaining and showing how to do basic functions in wikki js.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you edit any of the pages on the EHA wikis please keep the following in mind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li><mark class="marker-yellow"><strong>PLEASE ASSUME YOUR READER HAS <u>NO EHA EXPERIENCE </u>(this will be the case for all EHA new users).</strong></mark></li>
  <li>To extent the you can, <mark class="marker-blue"><strong>please use screenshots, photos and graphics to clearly illustrate your instructions.</strong></mark> &nbsp;A picture is worth a thousand words &nbsp;and that is particularly true here. &nbsp;Please make your instructions as user-friendly as possible.</li>
  <li>To the extent you can, itemize your steps - 1, 2, 3, etc.</li>
  <li>Please double-check you work.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you and happy editing!</p>

<p><span class="text-big"><strong>Logging In &amp; Editing a Wiki Page</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A person visiting the EHA Wiki can <strong><u>view</u></strong> content without logging in. &nbsp;If a user wants to <strong><u>edit</u></strong> content on the wiki the user needs to create an account and login. &nbsp;To do this, click on the icon with a person (head and shoulders in a circle) in the upper right of the screen. &nbsp;At the "Enter your credentials" page click on “Create an account.” &nbsp;Go through the “Create an account” process. At the end you will receive an email with a link to verify your account. Click on the link. &nbsp;Your account should now verified. &nbsp;You may need to login (again, just click on head and shoulders in a circle icon in the upper right of the screen and enter your credentials). &nbsp;You are now a “Guest.” &nbsp;As a “Guest” you do not have edit privileges yet. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Periodically, an Administrator of the wiki will automatically upgrade “Guests” to “Members.” &nbsp;As a “Member" you can add content to a wiki page, but not delete content. &nbsp;Below are instructions for adding content.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li>Before you can edit a page in the wiki you need permission.</li>
  <li>When you are given permission you then need to login to the wiki.</li>
  <li>In the upper right of the screen is an icon with a person (head and shoulders in a circle).&nbsp; If you hover over this it will say “Login.” Click on this.</li>
  <li>Enter your login credentials.</li>
  <li>Now, notice that you have new options in the upper right of the screen (see icons).</li>
</ol>

<p>Note: your icons may look different depending on the level of permissions you have.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>7. To edit the page you can either click on the p<strong>encil icon (with a blue background) in the lower right</strong> or <strong>point and click on the icon in the upper right that looks like a piece of paper with a pencil (if you hover over it – it says “Page Actions”) and then click on “Edit.” </strong>See photo.</p>

<p>8. The page is now loaded and you can edit and make changes to the wikki page.</p>
<p>9. <strong><u>Periodically click on “SAVE” in the upper right of the page to save your changes.</u></strong></p>
<p>10. When you are done making changes and after you have saved your changes click on “CLOSE.” If &nbsp;you click on “CLOSE” before saving your changes you will get a dialog box that says “Discard Unsaved Changes?,”&nbsp; click on “Cancel” and then save your changes and click on “CLOSE.”</p>

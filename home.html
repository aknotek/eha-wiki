<h1>Welcome to the Extreme Home Arcades Wiki</h1>
<p>The EHA Owner Community is a great community of likeminded individuals all willing to help each other get the most out of their EHA arcade machine. &nbsp;If you find a solution to a problem feel free to update the wiki to help others out. &nbsp;EHA machines are complicated PCs running a variety of emulators stitched together under a single front end to give the end user the best possible experience.</p>
<p>The latest series of drives is called Omega. &nbsp;More details can be found in the dedicated Omega section.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An EHA Purchasing Guide is also included. It is meant to help people considering the purchase of an EHA system make important decisions about their purchase. &nbsp;</p>
<p>A Wiki Guide is included to help you make changes to the wiki and update it with new content.</p>
<p><mark class="marker-yellow"><strong>NOTE: This wiki represents the opinions of people in the EHA owner community and does not represent the views of Extreme Home Arcades. &nbsp;</strong></mark></p>
